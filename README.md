## Code challenge


### Problem description

(ally)[https://www.allyapp.com/] as a product wants to start having presence as a web application. The aim of this web app is to eventually have a similar feature set to the mobile apps.

The product team wants to have a first MVP, but our design team is too busy working on other features with higher priority for the next 2 weeks.


### What we expect you to build

You can find an example of a route search response from our API included in this repository.

We would like you to build a UI that includes:

1. A comprehensive overview of all the routes in a single page.

2. Navigation to a detailed view of a single route, where more information is made available.

#### Advice

- You can take inspiration from our ally mobile apps in order to build the UI, but also feel free to impress us with your own ideas.

- Build an extensible solution, such that you could potentially add more features on top of it.

- Feel free to use modern tools and patterns to support your implementation.
